Forces and drivers:

Driver - Scalability:
The system needs to be scalable so that Västtrafik can expand their area of travel and their customer base without any
major reconstruction of our system, the system shall handle any increase of data being added.
Scalability would be a driver in our case as it is important to focus on this aspect early on in the development.

Driver - Extensibility:
Adding more features to our system will be important as more requirements will come later on in the development process,
we will have to think about how we design our system early on so that adding more functions is easy. Extensibility is a driver

Security:
The security aspect is very important since we are using customer data and location for analysis.
If this aspect of our system would fail the consequences would be detrimental,
västtrafik could get into legal problems and the traveler could possibly have their position and travel times leaked.

Reliability:
It is important for the data collected and represented to be reliable and correct for Västtrafik to be able to analyze it correctly.
Faulty data could result in investments being made in wrong places and time being wasted.

Modularity:
Since we are developing a distributed system modularity is an important aspect in the development process.
Each component should work independently of other components without breaking the entire system.
This force is also increasing the maintainability of our code.
