## About
This is a repository that documents the system.

It consists of sprint plans, requirements, user-stories, architecture, cost analysis forces and drivers amongst other things.

The system will provide useful information such as location, destination, timestamp of travelers, the purpose of travel as well as issuance. 

Transportation companies can use this tool to improve their services through visualization of the travellers data.

The visualization will allow the service provider to identify blindspots and routes which will assist the decision-making of the city planners.
